> “You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data.” — Daniel Keys Moran, Computer Scientist and Author

In the previous chapter, we introduced the idea of rectangular data vs. non-rectangular data before given examples of each. We outlined how to use a web-API before introducing the concept of web scraping by illustrating the language of the web: HTML. Since webpages can be complicated, scraping can be complicated. In this chapter, we will leverage the Selector Gadget and our knowledge of HTML elements to scrape data from various sources. It is our belief that the only way to teach web scraping is through examples.
