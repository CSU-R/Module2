In this chapter, we'll cover how to access data given in various forms and provided from various sources.

### ggplot

```{r}
rush_receive <- filter(rush_receive, pos %in% c('QB', 'RB', 'WR', 'TE'))
ggplot(data = rush_receive, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  labs(x = 'Age', y = 'Frequency', title = 'Distribution of Age') +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = rush_receive, aes(x = age, fill = pos)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~pos) +
  labs(x = 'Age', y = 'Frequency', title = 'Distribution of Age') +
  theme_bw()
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = rush_receive, aes(x = rushing_att, y = rushing_yds, color = pos, size = age)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y~x) +
  scale_color_brewer('Position', palette = 'Set1') +
  labs(x = 'Rush Attempts', y = 'Rushing Yards', title = 'Rushing Yards vs Rush Attempts') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = rush_receive %>%
         mutate(., yds = rushing_yds + receiving_yds), 
       aes(x = pos, y = yds, fill = pos)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_brewer('Position', palette = 'Set1') +
  labs(x = 'Po')
```
