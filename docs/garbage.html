<p>Again, these data need some work before they are useful, but we will defer to the next chapter. Right now, letâs focus on taking this methodology and applying it for every player on the 2020 Denver Broncos team who recorded statistics in rushing or receiving categories. Weâll need the web address for each player in the Rushing and Receiving table. Thankfully, this information must exist within the node which contains the table. Otherwise, the hyperlinks would not exist.</p>
<p>Weâll start by isolating the node containing the Rushing and Receiving statistics before scraping the web addresses.</p>
