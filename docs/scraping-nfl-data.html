<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Scraping NFL Data</h2>
<p>In Chapter <a href="AccessingData.html#AccessingData">2</a>, we gathered some betting data pertaining to the NFL through a web-API. We may wish to supplement these betting data with data pertaining to NFL teams, players, or even playing conditions. As we progress through this sub-section, examples will become increasingly problematic or troublesome. The goal in this subsection is to introduce you to scraping by heeding the advice given in the Chapter <a href="LessonsLearnedFromScraping.html#LessonsLearnedFromScraping">3.1</a>.</p>
<p>Following our own advice, letâs brainstorm. When you think of NFL data, you probably think of <a href="https://www.nfl.com/stats">NFL.com</a> or <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats">ESPN</a>. After further digging, we will explore <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/">Pro Football Reference</a>, a reliable archive for football statistics (with a reasonably simple webpage). This is an exhaustive source which boasts team statistics, player statistics, and playing conditions for various seasons. Letâs now start small by focusing on team statistics, but further, letâs limit our scope to the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/2020.htm">2020 Denver Broncos</a>. Notice, there are hyperlinks for each <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GordMe00.htm">player</a> documented in any of the categories, as well hyperlinks for each gameâs <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202009140den.htm">boxscore</a> where there is information about playing conditions and outcomes. Hence, we have a common thread between team statistics, players, and boxscores. If, for example, we chose to scrape team statistics from one website and player statistics from another website, we may have to worry about a unique identifier (being team) if the websites have different naming conventions.</p>
<div id="html-tables-team-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> HTML Tables: Team Statistics</h3>
<p>Weâll start with the team statistics for the 2020 Denver Broncos which can be found in a table entitled âTeam Stats and Rankingsâ. Weâll need to figure in which element or <strong>node</strong> the table lives within the underlying HTML. To do this, we will utilize the CSS selector gadget. If we highlight over and click the table with the selector gadget, we will see that the desired table lives in an element called â#team_statsâ.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-27"></span>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, we could view the page source and search for the table name. Iâve highlighted the information identified by the selector gadget with the cursor.</p>

</div>
<div class="caution">
<p>
While the selector gadget is always a great first option, it is not always reliable. There are instances when the selector gadget identifies a node that is hidden or inaccessible without JavaScript. In these situations, it is best view the page source directly for more guidance on how to proceed. Practice with both the selector gadget and the page source.
</p>
</div>
<p>Once we have found the name of the element containing the desired data, we can utilize the <code>rvest</code> package to scrape the table. The general process for scraping an HTML table is</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the HTML identified by the web address.</li>
<li>Isolate the node containing the data we desire.</li>
<li>Parse the HTML table.</li>
<li>Take a look at the data to ensure the columns are appropriate labels.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Commented and Hidden HTML Tables: Player Statistics</h3>
<p>Letâs transition to gathering player statistics, particularly for those players who have recorded statistics in the rushing or receiving category. These data are given in the table entitled âRushing and Receivingâ. Letâs use the selector gadget to identify the node containing the table and scrape the table according to the previous section.</p>

<pre class="sourceCode r error-style"><code>Error in UseMethod("html_table"): no applicable method for 'html_table' applied to an object of class "xml_missing"
</code></pre>
<p>We get an error stating that the node â#rushing_and_receivingâ does not contain an HTML table. In fact, there doesnât appear to be anything in that node at all.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r chunk-style"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-1" title="1">broncos_url <span class="op">%&gt;%</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-2" title="2"><span class="st">  </span><span class="co"># read the HTML</span></a>

<pre class="output-style"><code>{xml_missing}
&lt;NA&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This, of course, is contrary to the selector gadget declaring a node â#rushing_and_receivingâ as the one containing the table we desire and directly see on the webpage. Generally when this happens, it means the node containing the information in the table has either been <strong>commented out</strong> or <strong>hidden</strong>. A node is commented out when it is contained in a <strong>comment tag</strong>: <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>. For example, if we were to comment out the paragraph element in Chapter <a href="AccessingData.html#AccessingData">2</a>, it would look like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;!-- &lt;p class = "fancy"&gt; This is the paragraph you want to scrape which has been formatted in a fancy script. &lt;/p&gt; --&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When a node is commented out, it exists in the HTML, but it cannot be accessed until we step into the comment tag. Otherwise said, we canât bypass the comment node. If you would like to scrape information contained with a comment tag, the general strategy is</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the HTML identified by the web address.</li>
<li>Isolate the node containing the comment tag. Inside the comment tag are the data we desire.</li>
<li>Isolate the comment tag.</li>
<li>Convert the content to HTML.</li>
<li>Isolate the node containing the table.</li>
<li>Parse the HTML table.</li>
<li>Take a look at the data to ensure the columns are appropriate labels.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Attributes: Player Statistics by Game</h3>
<p>Suppose now that we wish to scrape the same player statistics, but rather than get the aggregated total, we want the playersâ statistics by game. Within the Rushing and Receiving table scraped in the previous example, there are hyperlinks for each player. When you click on this hyperlink, you will find the playerâs statistics for each game played. These are the data we desire. We want rushing and receiving statistics for each player on each team for a variety of years. Using the lessons learned in Chapter <a href="LessonsLearnedFromScraping.html#LessonsLearnedFromScraping">3.1</a>, we have brainstormed the problem and have a road map to the solution. We will first scrape the hyperlink attribute to get the web address associated with each player for a given team. Within each of these web addresses, we will scrape the game by game statistics before iterating over each team in the NFL. After this, we can repeat the procedure for a variety of years. This is, of course, a big job, so letâs scale down the problem to one player: Melvin Gordon III, running back. To do this, we will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get the web addresses associated with each player in the Rushing and Receiving table, before isolating the address associated with Melvin Gordonâs rushing and receiving statistics.</li>
<li>Read the HTML identified by the web address.</li>
<li>Isolate the node containing the data we desire.</li>
<li>Parse the HTML table.</li>
<li>Take a look at the data to ensure the columns are appropriate labels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Letâs figure out where the hyperlinks exist within the HTML code. To do this, I will look at the page source and search for Melvin Gordon. We find that the web address corresponding to his game by game player statistics exist in the hidden HTML table that we scraped in the previous example. In particular, they are the <code>href</code> attribute to a node entitled <code>a</code> which is embedded within the hidden HTML table. Phew. Letâs consider how we can scrape these web addresses step by step:</p>
<p>1.1 Isolate the hidden HTML table, similar to the previous example.
1.2 Isolate nodes with tag <code>a</code>.
1.3 Extract the <code>href</code> attribute from these nodes.</p>
<p>Steps 1.1 and 1.2 should be familiar from previous examples, but step 1.3 requires a new function within <code>rvest</code> called <code>html_attr</code>. Letâs see how to do this in <code>R</code>.</p>
